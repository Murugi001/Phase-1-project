# Aircraft Risk Analysis for Investment Decisions
## Problem Statement

The organizationâ€™s expansion into the aviation industry presents exciting growth opportunities but also significant risks that must be carefully managed. To support informed decision-making, this project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of aviation accident data to identify patterns, trends, and key risk factors associated with aircraft operations. By uncovering the root causes and common contributors to accidents, the project aims to generate actionable insights that can strengthen aviation safety practices, inform regulatory compliance, and guide investment strategies. Ultimately, the findings will help the organization, airlines, regulators, and passengers promote safer and more sustainable aviation operations.

## Project Goal
To indetify the aircraft with the lowest risk for company to venture in.

# Data Source

The data comes from a kaggle from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters. The project utilized 15 columns from original dataset.

## Data analysis 
The project employs the following methods: 1.Data Preprocessing: Cleaning data to handle missing values and ensure consistency. 2.Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing trends and patterns in accidents by phase, weather,purpose of the flight,number of engines  and  aircraft make. 3.Visualization: Interactive charts and dashboards created in Tableau for different stakeholders utilization.

## Key Findings
Cessna and Piper aircraft have by far the highest number of accidents, significantly more than any other manufacturers. Beech and Bell follow, but with far fewer cases. Boeing appears in both accident and incident records, with numbers that are close but still relatively low compared to Cessna and Piper.

Aircraft with 0-2 engines generally exhibit lower median injury counts, though they display a high number of outliers wkhile aircraft with 3-4 engines show significantly higher median injury counts and a wider spread of injuries

Weather conditions:VMC accounts for the highest number of injuries at 438,476.IMC accidents under poor visibility conditions account for 53,648 injuries.There were also 20,393 injuries reported under unknown weather conditions.

Most injuries occur during personal flights over the years, followed by flights with an undefined or unknown purpose. Instructional flights rank third in terms of injury frequency.

The highest number of injuries occur during the landing phase of flights, followed by injuries during cruise, takeoff, taxi, and approach phases, in that order.

##  Recommendations
To address these risks, it is recommended to invest in advanced training programs for pilots, with a particular focus on landing techniques, emergency landing procedures, and managing adverse weather conditions. In addition, equipping aircraft with the latest technology, such as Enhanced Vision Systems (EVS), Autoland systems, and Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS), will help pilots achieve more precise landings. Investments should prioritize the instructional aviation sector and related areas, as training institutions and aircraft used for flight instruction tend to have lower injury risks, leading to reduced operational liabilities.

Even under favorable weather conditions, it is important to exercise increased caution, enhance training, and maintain strong operational risk management practices. In the case of Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC), investing in aircraft with advanced avionics and navigation systems is advisable to further mitigate risks. When considering aircraft, models with one or two engines may be considered lower risk, provided rigorous maintenance and safety standards are in place to address the occasional high-severity events.

Although Cessna and Piper aircraft are popular, they may carry higher operational and insurance risks due to their higher accident rates. Beech and Bell aircraft, while safer, still require careful evaluation. Boeing aircraft present relatively lower risk levels, but they still warrant a thorough review to ensure safety and operational effectiveness.


# Next Steps
Collaborate with other stakeholders in aviation industry to implement the strategies above, Evaluate Insurance Implications to the company and Continously monitor the investment strategy.
