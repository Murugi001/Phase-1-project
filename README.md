# Aircraft Risk Analysis for Investment Decisions
## Problem Statement

The organizationâ€™s expansion into the aviation industry presents exciting growth opportunities but also significant risks that must be carefully managed. To support informed decision-making, this project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of aviation accident data to identify patterns, trends, and key risk factors associated with aircraft operations. By uncovering the root causes and common contributors to accidents, the project aims to generate actionable insights that can strengthen aviation safety practices, inform regulatory compliance, and guide investment strategies. Ultimately, the findings will help the organization, airlines, regulators, and passengers promote safer and more sustainable aviation operations.
